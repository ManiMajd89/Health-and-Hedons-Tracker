# Health-and-Hedons-Tracker
A simulation project that tracks health and hedons (happiness points) based on activities like running, carrying textbooks, and resting. The program considers user states (e.g., tiredness, star bonuses) to calculate the most enjoyable activities and update metrics over time. Designed for extensibility and includes built-in tests for validation.
